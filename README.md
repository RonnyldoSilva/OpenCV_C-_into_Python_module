# OpenCV C++ Into Python Module

Imagine writing a Computer Vision library using OpenCV. You want your code to be easily portable to Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android and even embedded devices. So you choose to build your library in C++ using OpenCV. Excellent choice!

### Requirements

Let’s start by making sure we have an updated system:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Now, let’s install NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib:
`sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib`

If you need OpenCV, you can install it with:
`sudo apt install python3-opencv`

Many useful Python libraries can be installed from https://pypi.org, let’s make sure we have pip on our system:
`sudo apt install python3-pip`

If you need to install a library from https://pypi.org, for example the Python Imaging Library Pillow, you can do it with:
`pip3 install Pillow`
